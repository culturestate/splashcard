# splashcard
A simple card-based splash page template

## What?
I find myself making a lot of quick and dirty splash pages based on a single, centered card layout. This is a simple template that I can use as a foundation.

## But why?
Never spend five minutes doing something that you can spend five hours failing to automate it.

## There are already so many of these.
I know, but this is one is *mine*.

## Alright fine, but why doesn't it support...?
Probably becuase I haven't needed that thing yet.

## Licensing
I can't imagine anyone else will actually use this, but nonetheless this project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.
